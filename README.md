# A* Path Finder
This is am implementation of the A* Path Finder algorithm.
I remmember it from my classes, some yars ago. So I decided to do this all by my head.

First we have an empty tile map.
Press SPACE to fill the map with walls.
Then click into some point to chose the init and the end point.
Press 1 to find and draw the best path between these two points.
