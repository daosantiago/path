# A* Path Finder
This is am implementation of the A* Path Finder algorithm. <br>
I remmember it from my classes, some yars ago. So I decided to do this all by my head.

First we have an empty tile map.<br>
Press SPACE to fill the map with walls.<br>
Then click into some point to chose the init and the end point.<br>
Press 1 to find and draw the best path between these two points.<br>
